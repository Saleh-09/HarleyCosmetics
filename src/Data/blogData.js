      intro: "Healthy, shiny hair is more than just a beauty goal it reflects how well you care for yourself inside and out. From the food you eat to the way you wash and style, every little habit contributes to the strength and glow of your hair. Here are three simple yet effective areas to focus on.",

          heading: "Nourish Your Hair from Within",
          text: "The journey to beautiful hair starts with proper nutrition. A diet packed with protein, vitamins, and minerals gives your hair the fuel it needs to grow strong and healthy. Foods like eggs, nuts, salmon, spinach, and berries provide essential nutrients that support growth and reduce breakage.\n\nAnd don't forget water hydration is just as important for your scalp as it is for your skin."

        {
          heading: "Gentle Washing and Conditioning",
          text: "Washing your hair daily might seem refreshing, but it can actually strip away natural oils that protect and moisturize your strands. Aim for two to three washes a week with a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo. Follow up with a nourishing conditioner to restore softness and shine.\n\nUse a wide-tooth comb on damp hair instead of harsh brushes, as wet hair is more delicate and prone to breakage."
        },
        {
          heading: "Protect and Style Smartly",
          text: "Styling is fun, but overdoing it can damage your hair. Minimize the use of straighteners, blow-dryers, and curling irons, or always apply a heat protectant when using them. Loose hairstyles are healthier than tight ponytails, which can stress your roots.\n\nFor added care, sleep on a silk pillowcase and schedule regular trims to keep split ends away."
